Getting Started
===============

The examples are laid out in incremental order and introduce inverted placeholder selector (fix names)
and a way of re-using SASS in the form of themes or skins.

Please start however you would like, looking at the *.scss* and the *.css* files to see how they are put together
and how they come out. When you feel comfortable, feel free to poke around try recompiling with SASS.
