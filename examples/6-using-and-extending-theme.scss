/* Demonstration page CSS using aspects from Theme B */
/* Assumes themeB.css is included before it */

// We want to use specific theme variables to maintain colors
@import "../themes/themeB/variables";

// We'll need to extend any components we want to affect, let's do twitter buttons

// Import button component IPE definition mixins
@import "../components/button/extends";

// Include the bootstrap button IPE definitions since themeB uses bootstrap style
@include define-button-bootstrap(); // We better match since we're tying to a specific theme!


// Crazy override for sales page or something
